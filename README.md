# My-Portfolio

This week a used the knowledge I have gained to make myself a portfolio. Its amateur at the moment but as the course goes on I plan to revisit this to stack it with projects (its empty at the moment) and make it reflect my personality.

## motovation
I wanted to make something that was as basic as possible. I think basic looks more professional so I used mostly whites and blacks, reserving the header and footer to have some flair with the wooden background. The images are just place holders, as I have no projects to link them too.
Though I decided to make them a little more fancy by adding a cool effect that shows that these projects are coming soon

## problems
This project was a slow start, as I tunneled in on what I wanted my porfolio to be not realising that I didnt yet have the skills to make it so advanced. I had dreams of a site where the user wouldnt have to scroll and everything would be displayed once clicked or hovered. As this was seemingly too advanced I shamedly sunk hours into trying to make it happen. This again is a reoccuring problem from my last project whereby I tend to go tunnel vision on an idea and waste away hours trying to realize it - when it is often unfeasable. This is something that I wish to work on as the course goes on

I also thought I wouldnt wirefrmae my website as I had all the ideas in my head. As a past filmmaker I should have known better as using story boards always makes the process 100x easier and wireframing is just basically that. After retreating and making a wireframe I found the project to become cleraer.

During the end of the project I wasnt able to make my fancy Coming Soon placeholder images responsive to the page. All other elements of the page respond to resizing. I am not sure I used the right technique to make the page responsive or what. This has made me come to realise that I need to utilize the tutoring program often and early during my projects as to not fall behind. As at the time of creating this README I have run short of time to work it out.
